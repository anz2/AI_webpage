					<h3>What You Need To Know About Artificial Intelligence</h3>
					<img src="../images/The-Basic-of-AI.png" />
					<p>When someone mentions “artificial intelligence”(AI), what is the first thing that comes to your mind?

Most of us imagine an army of human-like robots rebelling against humanity, while a few—folks from a more positive thinking community—are envisioning a bright future where AI serves them in all possible ways from walking a dog early in the morning when the weather is unpleasant to peeling tangerines at Christmas.

While the second scenario is certainly fun, it is a utopia per se. A reality with robots rising up against people, however, is a much more probable event.

If you believe AI will soon become the greatest existential threat to humanity, we’ve got some good news for you. Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking share your point of view. (What a way to boost your self-esteem, right?)

Jokes aside, the debate within the global tech community is not centered on the impact of human-like AI—as the general public thinks—but rather on the possibility of ever achieving this technology outright. Professionals are absorbed in discussions about how to define “human-like” and “intelligence.” These definitions may seem trivial to outsiders but understanding the human mind and intelligence are, in fact, critical to determining the timeline of milestones for AI. Experts are still not certain how this kind of intelligence will manifest or how soon day X will come, but it is clear that we are moving towards this reality with increasing speed.

This means it is high time to finally understand what AI is all about.
